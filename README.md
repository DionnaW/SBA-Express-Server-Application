# SBA-Express-Server-Application
3-25-24
i have my idea set for the project
i created all of my files, folders, and packages
taking a break!
i have a few routes running, but stuck, so back at it tomorrow

3-26-24
i added PUT and DELETE routes, but it's not running how it should at my local host
created query parameters and have success
stopping for now, and since i have 3 days i'm hoping to be finished tomorrow


3-28-24
i FINALLY got my DELETE method to work! i probably could have gotten it done yesterday but i am sick so...
i believe what i'm seeing with PATCH, that i have everything executing properly, so i'll mark this as
DONE!!
